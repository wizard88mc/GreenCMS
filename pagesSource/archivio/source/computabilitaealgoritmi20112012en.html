Unlimited Register Machines (URM).  Partial recursive functions. Equivalence of the models of computation. Universality for a model of computation. Church's Thesis.<br />- Enumerating the computable functions. Existence of non-computable functions: diagonalisation. SMN-theorem. Universal programs.<br />- Decidable, undecidable and semi-decidable problems. Undecidability of the halting problem. Reduction. Other undecidable problems.<br />- Recursive and partially recursive sets. Rice's theorem and Rice-Shapiro's theorem.<br />- Functionals. Recursive definitions. Partial orders, monotonic functions and fixpoints. Recursive functionals. Relating continuity and recursiveness. Myhill-Sheperdson's theorem. First recursion theorem. Second recursion theorem.<br /><br />The deepening of algorithmic techniques will discuss:<br />- Graph algorithms (Chapter 6 of the reference textbook). Breadth-first search and depth-first search. Topological sort. Strongly connected components. <br />- String algorithms. Fundamental preelaboration. Comparison based algorithms: Knuth Morris e Pratt algorithm, Boyer e Moore algorithm and Yao Corasich algorithm. Semi numerical algorithms: ShiftAnd algorithm and the Rabin e Karp. Fingerprint algorithm. Suffix trees and Ukonnen algorithm.<br />- Multithread algorithms. Chapter 27 of the reference textbook. <br />- Computational Geometry. Representation of geometric objects and fundamental algorithms. The algorithm of non intersection test for a set of segments. Convex hull algorithms: Graham algorithm and Jarvis algorithm. Finding the poligonal region that contains a given point.<br />- Two examples of randomized algorithms. Rendering algorithm. Routing algorithm.<br /></p>    <p class="withBorderBottom"><strong>Suggested Courses: </strong>- -</p>    <p class="withBorderBottom"><strong>Required Courses: </strong>- -</p>    <p class="withBorderBottom"><strong>Teaching Support Tools: </strong>- -</p>    <p><strong>Text Books: </strong>Nigel Cutland "Computability.
