<p class="withBorderBottom">The activity in mod. A takes for the most part the form of class lectures which serve to illustrate the main knowledge areas of software engineering. The classes, per area of knowledge, are accompanied by laboratory activities for the exploration of the practical implications of the theory learned in class. The lab activities are initially performed under the direct guidance of an instructor and subsequently carried out by students in full autonomy. At about 2/3 of the class period, the instructor publishes a formal invitation to tender for the execution of a small number of software projects, each focusing on a distinct application domain. The participating students are required to constitute project groups (in the form of "virtual enterprises") for submitting formal bids for the execution of one of the projects. The class period ends with the assessment of the submitted bids and the formalization of the relevant contractual obligations for the participating groups.</p>
