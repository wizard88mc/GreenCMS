The analysis of each subject will be complemented by the discussion of practical examples, first illustrated in class by the instructor and subsequently developed by the students in full autonomy. Though briefly, the class also touches on novel advanced paradigms such as virtualization and cloud computing.</p>    <p class="withBorderBottom"><strong>Suggested Courses: </strong>Computer architecture (architettura degli elaboratori)<br />Operating systems (sistemi operativi)<br />Computer Networks (reti)</p>    <p class="withBorderBottom"><strong>Required Courses: </strong>- -</p>    <p class="withBorderBottom"><strong>Teaching Support Tools: </strong>All presentation and support material used by the instructor will be made available electronically to the students, for download from URL http://www.math.unipd.it/~tullio/SCD/2010/</p>    <p><strong>Text Books: </strong>1.
