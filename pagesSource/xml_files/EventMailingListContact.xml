	<SpeakerCV>Gustavo Marfia received the Laurea degree in Telecommunications engineering from
the University of Pisa, Italy, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science
from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2009. Between 2002 and 2004
he worked for the applied research laboratories of Siemens Mobile
Communications. While at UCLA he also had the opportunity to collaborate and
spend active research periods at the Los Alamos National Labs, Microsoft
Research UK and at the Istituto Superiore Mario Boella in Turin. He has
co-authored one european patent and more than 20 publications. In 2009 he
joined the University of Bologna, where he is currently a Postdoctoral Research
Fellow at the Computer Science Department. His current research interests
include vehicular and biomedical networks and new technologies for computer
entertainment.</SpeakerCV>
	<Abstract>While vehicular congestion is very often defined in terms of aggregate
parameters such as traffic volumes and lane occupancies, based on recent
findings the interpretation that receives most credit is that of a state of a
road where traversing vehicles experience a delay exceeding the maximum value
typically incurred under light or free-flow traffic conditions. We here propose
a new definition, according to which a road is in a congested state (be it high
or low) only when the likelihood of finding it in the same congested state is
high in the near future. Based on this new definition, we devised an algorithm
which, exploiting probe vehicles, for any given road: (a) identifies if it is
congested or not, and; (b) provides the estimation that a current congested
state will last for at least a given time interval. Unlike any other existing
approach, an important advantage of ours is that it can be generally applied to
any type of road, as it neither needs any a-priori knowledge nor require to
estimate any road parameter (e.g., number of lanes, traffic light cycle, etc.).
Further, it allows to perform short term traffic congestion forecasting for any
given road. We present several field trials gathered on different urban roads
whose empirical results confirm the validity of our approach.</Abstract>

	<Abstract>L'Informatica Pediatrica è la branca delle scienze informatiche che si occupa di massimizzare il livello di maturazione e di sviluppo di OGNI persona in età evolutiva tramite opportune tecnologie digitali. Queste, se utilizzate precocemente, prevengono comportamenti disadattivi e favoriscono i processi riabilitativi.</Abstract>
